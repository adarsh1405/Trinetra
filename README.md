## Introduction
An E-Biometric Attendance app which aims for a contacless , secure & accurate attendance which covers all the loopholes from the present *Biometric System* .

## Problems in the Present *Biometric System*  
* Since it is the period of COVID-19 , all the people are focusing towards their health , Biometric Attendance systems which are installed in various sectors like malls, Schools , Hospitals  can be a nightmare for various people . People are creating many innovative ideas of contactless approach.
* There are some **loopholes** in the current Biometric attendance system , Let us discuss some of the loopholes :-
  1. Data can be easily tampered.
  2. A person can roam easily after giving the attendance without getting caught.
  3. Electricity Depended.
  4. Installation is very expensive.
  5. Sometimes Inaccurate.  

## Our Approach
Creating an App which will be installed in every employee's mobile phone and with it they can give the attendance from their mobile phones which also covers all the loopholes from the current scenario.
* Contactless attendance.
* Fast & secure.
* Electricity Independent.
* Almost free of Cost.
* Accurate.

### **Our Innovative Feature**
All the Employees will get notification to give attendance at the start and the end of the session with their mobileâ€™s fingerprint sensor or by verifying their Face Ids. Prior to the loopholes,  The employees will additionally have to give randomly 3-4 times attendance on the same day. After successful registration ,  timestamp as well as their geolocation details will be sent to the database in the cloud , if the employee at the time of attendance mapped outside the periphery  of the building , his/her attendance fails for that day.
